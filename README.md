## Dependencies
This repo contains the source of the awesome [reveal.js](http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) slideshow library. Thanks Hakkem.

If you want to have the repo installed with Grunt will also need to have grunt.js [installed](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#installation) to build and run it from ( http://localhost:8000/ ) in your browser of choice ( any recent browser will do ) as the library uses some CSS 3 mojo and should render properly on recent browsers.
